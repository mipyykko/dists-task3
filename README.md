## Push notifications

This is a simple push notification demo for the Distributed Systems course.

It consists of two parts - the server and the client. Both have their own README files, in case you want to run this thing locally.

In any case: you start the server and then launch client(s), who in register themselves on the server. After the server has at least one registrant, it starts spewing notifications for everyone.
