## Firebase messaging server

If you want to try this on your own, create a new Firebase app. Get your service account key file from project settings, and save it to this directory with the name `serviceaccount.json`.

Then it's just `yarn` and `yarn serve`. The default port is 8082; if you want to change it, remember to edit it on the client as well.
